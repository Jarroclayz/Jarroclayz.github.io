<h1>OVERWORLD</h1>
<title>Mario & Luigi: Bowsers' Inside Story - Overworld</title>

<p>
  Outside of Battle, Bowser explores the Mushroom Kingdom, whilst the Bros explore Bowser's Body, and eventually, the Mushroom Kingdom as well.<br>
  However, traversing locales such as Dimble Wood and Bumpsy Plains isn't easy, so the Bros and Bowser each have their own dynamic moves to traverse the world.<br>
  <br>

    <strong>JUMP</strong><br>
    <br>
    As they do in battle, the Bros can jump around throughout Bowser's body and the overworld. Upon entering the overworld, the Bros can use their jumps to explore areas that Bowser was unable to reach.

    <strong>HAMMER</strong><br>
    <br>
    Upon awaking in the trash pit (Bowser's Belly), the Bros manage to find a pair of sturdy hammers. Use them throughout Bowser's body and the overworld to smash crates, stones and other seemingly indestructible objects to pave the way forward.<br>

    <strong>WHRILWIND</strong><br>
    <br>
    Mario hops on top of Luigi's shoulders with his arms stretched out. Both of the Bros then spin together to lift them up into the air, enabling them to hover for a short period of time, perfect for crossing large gaps.

    <strong>DRILL</strong><br>
    <br>
    Luigi hops on top of Mario's shoulders, holding a hammer in hand. Both of the Bros then spin together, sending them tunnelling into the ground. Although movement is slower, the bros can now travel underneath walls and unearth treasures.

    <strong>MINI MARIO</strong><br>
    <br>
    Upon the advice of a wise Toad, Mario and Luigi learn that their hammers have a secret use. If Luigi bonks Mario on the head with his hammer, Mario will shrink down to miniature form, and is now able to pass through small gaps.<br>

    <strong>PUNCH</strong><br>
    <br>
    Similar to how the Bros use their hammers, Bowser can use his punch to obliterate massive blocks and objects in his path. His swings are so powerful, that punching an enemy in the overworld can defeat them before a battle even begins!<br>

    <strong>FIRE</strong><br>
    <br>
    Bowser's unleashes a volley of flames in a short cone in front of him, burning anything in his paths. Use it to clear out dead trees, light torches or generally just wreak havoc.

    <br>
    <strong>SLIDING HAYMAKER</strong><br>
    <br>
    An upgrade to the basic punch, the sliding haymaker adds a bit more oomph to Bowser's punches. He now zooms across the screen, giving him enough speed to gain a little airtime, allowing him to cross some small gaps.

    <strong>SHELL SLAM</strong><br>
    <br>
    Bowser leaps directly up and into the air, before retreating into his shell, and slamming back into the ground, creating a small shockwave around him, just the right move for pressing large switches or crushing through terrain.

    <strong>SPIKE BALL</strong><br>
    <br>
    After Mario and Luigi manage to loosen the muscles in Bowser's Back, he can now curl up into a spiky ball. This ability lets Bowser roll around at high speeds, whilst his spiky shell lets him roll up walls made of soft soil.
