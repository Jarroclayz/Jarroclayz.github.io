A council meeting is immediately called at Princess Peach’s Castle, in which important figures such as <strong>Mario</strong>, <strong>Luigi</strong>, <strong>Princess Peach</strong> and <strong>Toadsworth</strong> have gathered to discuss what can be done about the epidemic. It is discovered that infected Toads had recently eaten a mushroom from a mysterious salesman.<br> <!--Marks the beggining of paragraph text, containing text bolding and a line break-->
