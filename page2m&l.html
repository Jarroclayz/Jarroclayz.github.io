<h1>CHARACTERS</h1>
<title>Mario & Luigi: Bowsers' Inside Story - Characters</title>

<div class="synopsiscont">
  <p class="synopsis">The Mushroom Kingdom has been plagued by a disease called The <strong>Blorbs</strong>, a mysterious infection that has caused the Toads to inflate like balloons and roll uncontrollably. A council meeting is immediately called at Princess Peach’s Castle, in which important figures such as <strong>Mario</strong>, <strong>Luigi</strong>, <strong>Princess Peach</strong> and <strong>Toadsworth</strong> have gathered to discuss what can be done about the epidemic. It is discovered that infected Toads had recently eaten a mushroom from a mysterious salesman.<br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, <strong>Bowser</strong> is infuriated that he had not been invited to the Council meeting. Upon his journey to Princess Peach’s council, he encounters this same salesman, who feeds him a Lucky(?) Shroom, causing Bowser to inhale uncontrollably. Upon arriving at the Castle, Bowser storms into the meeting room, inhaling the entire cast of characters, before promptly fainting.<br>
    <br>
    It is now up to Bowser to uncover these mysteries, whilst Mario and Luigi try to escape the insides of Bowser’s body!<br>

      Unaware of his newfound inhabitants, Bowser awakes in Cavi Cape Cave, and begins the journey back to his castle, only to find out that Fawful is controlling the minds of all his minions. He then sets out to track down and defeat Fawful, swarmed by hordes of mechanised weaponry and Fawful's zany henchmen. However, below the surface, it seems that there are greater forces at play...
